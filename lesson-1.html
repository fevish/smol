                <h1>The Basics</h1>
                <p>In this first lesson, we will learn how to use simple text editor tools on your computer to create
                    the most basic type of website.
                    In future lessons we will be upgrading to more advanced (and free to use) tools, but for now these
                    will be sufficient.
                </p>
                <p>All of these lessons are meant to be completed on a computer running any version of Windows or Mac
                    OS.</p>

                <h2>Folder and Text Editor Setup</h2>
                <p>For the purpose of these lessons, we are going to assume the user or user's supervisor (parent,
                    sibling, teacher etc.) has a basic understanding on
                    using their computer's operating system.</p>
                <p>To begin, we are going to create a new folder on our desktop and call it
                    <code><b>HTML Lessons</b></code>.
                </p>
                <a class="image-link" href="{{ site.tut }}new-folder-embark.jpg"><img
                        src="{{ site.tut }}new-folder-embark.jpg"></a>
                <p>Next, we will open up our text editor. If you are using Windows, open <b>Notepad</b>. You can
                    accomplish this by typing <b>Notepad</b> into your search bar to open a blank notepad.
                    On Mac, the equivalent is called <b>TextEdit</b>.
                </p>
                <p>Once your text editor is open, you should see something similar to this:
                </p>
                <a class="image-link" href="{{ site.tut }}embark-notepad.jpg"><img
                        src="{{ site.tut }}embark-notepad.jpg"></a>
                <p>Now click <code>File > Save As..</code> and save the file name as <code>index.html</code> in the
                    folder we created earlier called
                    <code><b>HTML Lessons</b></code>.
                    Make sure you indicate <b>Save as type:</b> to <b>All Files (*.*)</b>. </p>
                <a class="image-link" href="{{ site.tut }}notepad-save-as-embark.jpg"><img
                        src="{{ site.tut }}notepad-save-as-embark.jpg"></a>
                <p>You should now see your new <code>HTML</code> file in your lessons folder. Go ahead and open that
                    file. By default the file should open up in your web browser (Chrome, Edge or Safari etc.). This is
                    because this is an <code>HTML</code> file, which is a web page file.</p>
                <p>You probably noticed that your file loaded to a blank white page. We haven't put any code or content
                    in it yet.. let's fix that!
                </p>
                <h6>Keep your web browser open. Minimize it or resize it to fit half your screen.</h6>
                <h2>
                    Hello World!
                </h2>
                <p>Time to write our first block of <code>HTML</code> code. Right now, when we opened up our HTML
                    file it loaded in our default web browser. We must also open our file in our text editor to edit
                    it. Navigate to <code>Desktop > HTML Lessons > index.html</code> and right click on our
                    <code>index.html</code> file and click <code>Open with > Notepad</code>. If you do not see
                    Notepad in the list, then select <code>Select another App</code> and locate Notepad.</p>
                <p>Now that you have your HTML file open in your text editor, we are going to begin writing our
                    first block of code.</p>
                <p>Starting from the first line, type the following:</p>
{{ site.code }}
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
{{ site.endcode }}
                <p>Save your file <code>File > Save</code> and open up your <code>HTML</code> file in your web
                    browser. If the file is already open in your browser, then click refresh (shortcut:
                    <code>F5</code>). You should see the following:</p>
                <a class="image-link" href="{{ site.tut }}first-hello-world-embark.jpg"><img
                        src="{{ site.tut }}first-hello-world-embark.jpg"></a>
                <h3>Congratulations! &#x1F973;</h3>
                <p>You've created your first "Hello World" page.<br> But we're not done yet, keep going!</p>

                <h2>Markup</h2>
                <p>With both your <code>index.html</code> web page and your text editor open, let's add some proper
                    elements, tags and markup. First we will add our HTML and BODY elements to our code. Update and
                    save your
                    code with the following:</p>
{{ site.code }}
<html>
<body>

    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first website.</p>

</body>
</html>
{{ site.endcode }}
                <p>Result:</p>
                <div class="result">
                    <h4>Hello World!</h4>
                    <p>This is my first website.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Look back at your code. Most HTML elements require opening <code>&lt; &gt;</code> and closing
                    <code>&lt; /&gt;</code> tags.
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>&lt;html&gt;</code> is the root element of an HTML page. This element tells the
                            browser that this is an HTML document and is the container for nearly all other HTML
                            elements. The <code>html</code> element has opening
                            <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and closing <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> tags. <i>Notice the
                                order of our elements, how they cascade to mirror themselves, and close with
                                <code>/</code> appended to the element name.</i></li>
                        <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code> is where all of our webpage content lives. Everything between
                            the opening and closing body tags will be seen visually by the viewer (text, images,
                            etc.).</li>
                        <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is a heading element. It is used for large heading text to
                            capture attention. Heading elements need opening <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and closing
                            <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> tags.</li>
                        <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is a paragraph element. It is used for most written text in
                            websites. By now you probably are noticing that most elements require closing
                            <code>&lt;/ &gt;</code> tags.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Modify your code and remove the closing <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> tag, then refresh your page
                        and see the result.</p>
{{ site.code }}
<html>
<body>

<h1>Hello World! -
<p>This is my first website.</p>

</body>
</html>
{{ site.endcode }}
                    <p>Result:</p>
                    <div class="result">
                        <h4>Hello World!
                            <p>This is my first website.</p>
                            <p>Closing your tags is important! If you forget to close a tag, it is often VERY
                                noticable on your webpage.</p>
                        </h4>

                        <h2>Add a splash of color</h2>
                        <p>Now that we have created a basic web page, we are going to learn some styling basics.
                            There are two primary ways to style your website: <code>stylesheets</code> and
                            <code>inline styles</code>. We will learn about stylesheets in another lesson, for now
                            we will stick to inline styles.</p>
                        <p>Inline styling is the most basic way to style elements in a website. Let's go back to our
                            code and fix our closing H1 tag, and add a bit of color. Add the following to your code:
                        </p>
                    </div>
{{ site.code }}
<html>
<body>

<h1 style="color:teal; font-size: 50px;">Hello World!</h1>
<h1>I am smol.</h1>
<p>This is my first website.</p>

</body>
</html>
{{ site.endcode }}

                <p>Result:</p>

                <div class="result">
                    <h4 style="color:teal; font-size: 50px;">Hello World!</h4>
                    <h4>I am smol.</h4>
                    <p>This is my first website.</p>
                </div>

                <p>It may not look elegant yet, but you've just learned how to paint with code! Imagine what you
                    can do once you learn some more styles!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>style=" "</code> This tells the tag that we are applying inline styling to it.
                        Notice the opening and closing apostrophes.
                    <li><code>color: red;</code> This is a declaration. We have two parts to our declaration:
                        Propert and Value. <i>color</i> is the property, and <i>red</i> is the value.</li>
                    <li><code>font-size: 50px;</code> <i>font-size</i> is a property, and <i>50px</i> is a
                        value. <i>px</i> stands for pixels. Notice the semicolon <code>;</code> at the end of
                        our declarations. Make sure you always end a declaration with a semicolon.</li>
                    <li>Did you notice that our inline styling ONLY APPLIES to the single
                        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element it was applied to? If you want to apply a style to
                        multiple elements, you can do this with <code>stylesheets</code> which we will learn
                        about in the next lesson!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Whoa, that's a great start! We just learned how to create a local web page, and the basic
                    building blocks of HTML.</p>
                <p>Go ahead and play with your code; try adding some styles to the other elements and see what
                    happens. Here are a few new styles to try out and see what happens (try different
                    values):<br><br>
                    <code>font-style: bold, italic, underline; <br>background-color: yellow; <br>text-align: center, left, right;</code>
                </p>

                <p>If you got stuck anywhere in this lesson, just scroll back and go over the sections again.
                    Once you have a comfortable grasp on what you are doing here, then it's time to move on to
                    the next lesson!
                    </p>
